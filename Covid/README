## Covid

**File:** `Covid_Exploratory.sql`  
This project explores Covid-19 deaths and vaccination data from around the world using SQL.  

**Key Activities:**
- Data exploration and filtering by continent and country.
- Calculating key metrics such as:
- Death percentage per country and globally.
- Percent of population infected.
- Highest infection and death counts by country and continent.
- Aggregation of new cases and deaths.
- Use of common table expressions (CTEs) to analyze vaccination progress vs. population.
- Creation and use of temporary tables and SQL views for advanced analysis and easier visualization.
- Joins between deaths and vaccination data to analyze relationships and trends.

Youâ€™ll find queries that identify trends, compare cases and deaths, track vaccination rollouts, and create artifacts (views, temp tables) for visual analytics.
